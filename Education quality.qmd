1.  

    ```         
    What are the different high school quality indicators published by the ministry of higher education?
    ```



2.  

    ```         
    How is the value-added measure (IVAL, indicateur de valeur ajoutée), calculated?
    ```

3.  

    ```         
    How do the IVAL and other indicators correlate with IPS (indicateurs de position sociale, a higher IPS indicates the higher average socio-economic status of parents at the school level) in Paris? Can you propose a way to represent graphically the correlations, for High schools in Paris (separately for public and private high schools)?
    ```

```{r}
library(vroom)
library(here)
here::i_am("quality_education.Rproj")
quality_indicators <- vroom(here("data", "fr-en-indicateurs-de-resultat-des-lycees-gt_v2.csv"))
ips <- vroom(here("data", "fr-en-ips_lycees.csv"))
ival <- vroom(here("data", "ival-2024-154664.xlsx"))
